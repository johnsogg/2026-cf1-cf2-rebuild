# Variables and Functions

A **variable** is a named container that holds a value. You create one with `let` or
`const`, give it a name, and assign a value:

```ts
const name = "Alice"
let age = 30
```

The value stored in a `let` variable can be updated later; `const` values cannot.

## Functions

A **function** is a reusable block of code. You define it once and call it whenever
you need it:

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet("world")) // Hello, world!
```

Functions can accept **parameters** (inputs) and **return** a value. TypeScript lets
you annotate both with types, so the editor catches mistakes before you run the code.

## Objects

An **object** groups related values under a single name:

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Smith",
}
```

You access fields with dot notation: `person.firstName` is `"Alice"`.

Now try combining all three ideas — variables, functions, and objects — in the
exercise below.
