# Hello, World

This is a lesson rendered from an **MDX file**. Prose is written in Markdown;
interactive exercises will be embedded as JSX components.

## What this will become

Each lesson will be a document like this one — a mix of explanation and
practice. You'll write code directly on the page and get instant feedback, with
no server involved.

## A sample code block

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('world')) // Hello, world!
```

When the full pipeline is wired up, read-only blocks like this will have syntax
highlighting, and exercise blocks will be editable.
