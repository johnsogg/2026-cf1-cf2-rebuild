**Data Structures Mid-Semester Survey Analysis**

February 2026 \| 20 of 48 students responded (42% response rate)

Executive Summary

This survey captures feedback from the 20 most engaged students in the
course---those regularly attending lecture and recitation. The results reveal a
significant gap in foundational programming skills that is impeding students'
ability to engage with data structures content. The core finding: **60% of
respondents are struggling with TypeScript syntax and grammar, and 50% are
struggling with data structure concepts.** Multiple students describe being
unable to start assignments independently, even after understanding material
when it's explained step-by-step. This points to a transfer gap between the
prerequisite course and this one.

Key Findings

Where Students Are Struggling

| **Area** | **Struggling Most** | **Struggling Least** |
|---|---|---|
| **Code syntax and grammar** | **12 (60%)** | 6 (30%) |
| Data structure concepts | 10 (50%) | 9 (45%) |
| GitHub/VS Code/other tech | 3 (15%) | 11 (55%) |
| Unit tests | 3 (15%) | 3 (15%) |

**Key observation:** Syntax/grammar is the \#1 struggle area by a wide margin.
These students have already taken the prerequisite programming course. The fact
that 60% of actively-engaged students still struggle with syntax suggests the
prerequisite may not be providing sufficient TypeScript-specific preparation, or
that the jump between courses is too steep.

Programming Comfort Levels (1--5 scale)

  ------------- --------- --------- --------- -------------- **1 (Low)** **2**
  **3** **4** **5 (High)** 1 (5%) 3 (15%) 7 (35%) 6 (30%) 3 (15%) -------------
  --------- --------- --------- --------------

**Average comfort: 3.4/5.** 55% of students rate themselves at a 3 or below.
Only 7 of 20 students (35%) said their comfort has improved since the start of
the semester. Among the 12 students struggling with syntax, their average
comfort is just 3.0.

The Deeper Concern: Transfer & Problem-Solving Gaps

The qualitative responses paint a picture that goes beyond syntax. Students are
struggling to independently start and work through problems. Selected quotes:

> *"When I am doing the homework I feel lost as to where to even start. I can
> understand when it is explained to me step by step, but if I go home and try
> to do it I am lost as to what to do. I feel like I do not understand how to
> call things or what to call or what functions are doing unless it is explained
> step by step. I feel like I could not apply these concepts outside of this
> class."*
> 
> --- Student in Section 014, comfort level 2/5
> 
> *"I have taken Comp 1 but this class concepts feel a lot more difficult. I
> feel a bit behind in this class."*
> 
> --- Same student
> 
> *"\[I'm struggling with\] thinking about things and asking questions of 'what
> do I do' in the right way."*
> 
> --- Student in Section 012, comfort level 5/5

This last quote is particularly telling: even a student who rates themselves 5/5
on programming comfort recognizes they lack the problem-solving framework to
approach data structures problems. The gap isn't just about typing correct
TypeScript---it's about knowing how to decompose a problem and translate it into
code.

Response Rate & Selection Bias

Only 20 of 48 students (42%) responded. These respondents are the students
actively attending class and recitation---theoretically the most engaged and
best-supported students. If 60% of *these* students are struggling with syntax,
it's reasonable to expect the non-respondents (who may be less engaged) are
struggling at equal or higher rates.

Bright Spots

-   **LA satisfaction is high.** Average of 4.5/5 for explaining concepts. 100%
    of students feel comfortable approaching their LA for help. Multiple
    students left glowing praise for their LAs.

-   **Office hours are valued.** 11 of 20 said office hours have been helpful.
    One student said "EXTREMELY." However, 4 students haven't been able to
    attend due to scheduling conflicts.

-   **Tech stack isn't the bottleneck.** 55% say GitHub/VS Code is their least
    challenging area, suggesting the tooling introduction is working well.

-   **Peer support is happening.** Students mention feeling comfortable talking
    to classmates in recitation and working through problems on the whiteboard.

Discussion Points / Potential Actions

Based on these findings, here are some areas worth discussing:

1\. Prerequisite Course Alignment

Could the first programming course (Comp 1) incorporate more TypeScript-specific
syntax practice and problem decomposition exercises? Students are arriving in
Data Structures without the fluency needed to focus on the actual data
structures content. If students are spending cognitive energy on syntax, they
have less capacity for the conceptual material.

2\. Bridging Activities

A "warm-up" module or resource at the start of the semester that refreshes
TypeScript fundamentals in the context of data structures could help.
Alternatively, a brief syntax reference guide that students can use alongside
assignments.

3\. Problem-Solving Scaffolding

Several students describe understanding material when walked through it but
being unable to start on their own. This suggests a need for explicit teaching
of problem decomposition strategies---perhaps through structured recitation
exercises where students practice breaking problems into steps before coding.

4\. Office Hours Accessibility

Four students reported not being able to attend office hours due to scheduling.
Expanding time slots or offering asynchronous support options could help.

5\. Recitation Structure

A couple of students requested more structured recitations with brief lecture
reviews. Since recitations are optional, some students aren't attending. Making
the value proposition clearer or adding a brief conceptual review component
could increase attendance and reinforce learning.

LA Confidence Ratings by Section

\"My LA helps me with problems in a way that makes me feel confident doing it on
my own\" (1--5 scale):

  --------------- ------------------------ ----------------------------
  **Section** **Avg: Explains Well** **Avg: Builds Confidence** 011 - Reid 3.8
  3.8 012 - Sage ML 5.0 4.3 013 - Sydney 5.0 4.0 014 - Sage E 4.2 3.8
  --------------- ------------------------ ----------------------------

**Note:** Section 012 and 013 scores reflect smaller sample sizes (4--5
responses each). The confidence-building gap between "explains well" and "builds
confidence" is consistent across sections, which may relate to the underlying
syntax/problem-solving challenges rather than LA performance.
